“Changing Perceptions of Robotics in Industry: Recent  Accomplishment in Safety and Injury Risk Reduction”.
He discussed what are the old, current and future solution for injury reduction in human-robot collaboration 
and mentioned that there will be a new generation of collaborative robots, he names them “intelligent collaborative robots”,
that they have human biomechanics, ergonomics, and safety included in motion perception, planning and control algorithms 
of collaborative robots. He reviewed the most cutting-edge researches in ergonomy and safety in HRC/HRI and introduces
the current challenges in this area of research. He also suggested several new research ideas and opportunities for 
both robotics and safety and health communities.
